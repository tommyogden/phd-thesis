\section{Introduction}
  \label{sec:propagation_intro}

    In this chapter we will define the model for propagation in thermal atoms to
    be used throughout the thesis, based on the well-known Maxwell Bloch
    (\textsc{mb}) equations. We will introduce the concept of susceptibilities
    and discuss analytic solutions to the equations that are available in the
    regime of weak incident light, before generalising the problem to nonlinear
    interaction with quantised atoms. Finally we will present results from
    numerical solutions and compare with the analytic results for weak fields to
    verify the accuracy of the numerical model.
