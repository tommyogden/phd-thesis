\section{Discussion}
  \label{sec:nonlinear_discussion}

    In this chapter we have taken the model introduced in chapter
    \ref{chp:propagation} for propagation of light in thermal two-level atomic
    vapours beyond the weak probe regime to consider nonlinear phenomena,
    specifically the propagation of optical solitons via self-induced
    transparency. We then extended the quantised atom model to consider 
    three-level atom configurations, which present a range of interesting 
    properties due to the presence of quantum superposition dark states. Finally  
    we considered the theoretical concept of simultaneous optical solitons,
    \textit{simultons} in V-type three-level configurations.

    We continue in chapter \ref{chp:polaritons} with an investigation into
    another nonlinear propagation effect with an investigation of dark-state
    polaritons in $\Lambda$-type atoms.
