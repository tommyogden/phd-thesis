\section{Discussion}
  \label{sec:nonlinear_discussion}

    In this chapter we have taken the model introduced in chapter
    \ref{chp:propagation} for propagation of light in thermal two-level atomic
    vapours beyond the weak probe regime to consider nonlinear phenomena,
    specifically the propagation of optical solitons via self-induced
    transparency. We then extended the quantised atom model to consider 
    three-level atom configurations, which present a range of interesting 
    properties
    due to the presence of quantum superposition dark states. Finally we
    considered the theoretical concept of simultaneous optical solitons,
    \textit{simultons} in V-type three-level configurations.

    This completes the part of the thesis dedicated to presenting theoretical
    background, and in the following chapters we will present original research
    findings based on the concepts we've introduced. We start in chapter
    \ref{chp:polaritons} with an investigation into the propagation of 
    dark-state polaritons in $\Lambda$-type atoms.
