abstract = {In computational dealings with splines, the question of representation is of primary importance. For splines of fixed order on a fixed partition, this is a question of choice of basis, since such splines form a linear space. Only three kinds of bases for spline spaces have actually been given serious attention; those consisting of truncated power functions, of cardinal splines, and of B-splines. Truncated power bases are known to be open to severe ill- conditioning, while cardinal splines are difficult to calculate. By contrast, bases consisting of B-splines are well-conditioned, at least for orders < 20. Such bases are also local in the sense that at every point only a fixed number (equal to the order) of B-splines is nonzero. B-splines are also evaluated quite easily, using their definition as a divided difference of the truncated power function. Unfortunately, such calculations are ill-conditioned, particularly for partitions of widely varying interval lengths, as is indicated by the fact that special measures have to be taken in case of coincident knots. In this note, a different way of evaluating B-splines is discussed which is very well conditioned yet efficient, and which needs no special adjustments in case of coincident knots. It is also shown that the condition of the B-spline basis increases exponentially with the order.},

The general case of unequal oscillator strengths of two electric dipole transitions in an atom is studied analytically, and the adiabaticity criterion for the matter-field interaction is derived. It is shown that the interaction adiabaticity strongly depends on the relationship between oscillator strengths. A simple expression specifying the critical propagation length at which the stimulated Raman adiabatic passage process is still effective is derived. An estimate of the propagation distance at which a complete energy transfer from the pump pulse into the Stokes pulse occurs is made. DOI:},

We use a bandwidth-limited pulsed excitation and observe up to 6 full Rabi cycles within a pulse duration of ∼4  ns. We find good agreement between the experiment and numerical simulations based on a surprisingly simple model. This result shows that fully coherent dynamics with Rydberg states can be achieved even in thermal atomic vapor, thus suggesting small vapor cells as a platform for room-temperature quantum devices. Furthermore, the result implies that previous coherent dynamics in single-atom Rydberg gates can be accelerated by 3 orders of magnitude.},

@article{Konopnicki1981,
abstract = {The propagation of two short different-wavelength optical pulses in$\backslash$nthree-level absorbers is studied. Combined numerical and analytic$\backslash$ntechniques are used to solve the three-level Maxwell-Bloch equations$\backslash$nthat provide the semiclassical description of the problem. The electric$\backslash$nfield in the model studied consists of two copropagating plane waves,$\backslash$neach of which is in near resonance with a transition in the absorber.$\backslash$nA new conservation law, holding in the absence of relaxation mechanisms,$\backslash$nand independent of particular values of fields and detunings, is$\backslash$ngiven. It is an analog of the law expressing conservation of the$\backslash$nBloch vector length known for two-level atoms. The possibility of$\backslash$nsimultaneous lossless propagation of the two optical pulses is established.$\backslash$nNew analytic solutions having the form of simultaneous different-wavelength$\backslash$noptical solitons have been found. These pairs of solitons are called$\backslash$nsimultons. In order for simulton propagation to occur, both the$\backslash$npulses and the medium have to be prepared in a manner determined$\backslash$nby the medium's physical parameters. The conditions for such preparation$\backslash$nare given. Simultons are predicted to be distinct from the single-wavelength$\backslash$nmultiple-pulse solutions resulting from large-area-pulse breakup$\backslash$nknown in two-level absorbers, as well as from two-photon self-induced$\backslash$ntransparency. Results of numerical experiments on different-wavelength$\backslash$nsimultaneous propagation are also presented and indicate that simultaneous$\backslash$npropagation may also be obtained under less stringent conditions$\backslash$nthan those predicted by the analytic solutions. Evidence of pulse$\backslash$nevolution and breakup is seen.},

abstract = {We show that two photons coupled to Rydberg states via electromagnetically induced transparency can interact via an effective Coulomb potential. This interaction gives rise to a continuum of two-body bound states. Within the continuum, metastable bound states are distinguished in analogy with quasi-bound states tunneling through a potential barrier. We find multiple branches of metastable bound states whose energy spectrum is governed by the Coulomb potential, thus obtaining a photonic analogue of the hydrogen atom. Under certain conditions, the wavefunction resembles that of a diatomic molecule in which the two polaritons are separated by a finite "bond length." These states propagate with a negative group velocity in the medium, allowing for a simple preparation and detection scheme, before they slowly decay to pairs of bound Rydberg atoms.},

The experimental procedure and analysis are similar to those used in a recent study of energy-pooling collisions in cesium. In potassium, it was found that 4P1/2+4P1/2 collisions are more efficient than 4P3/2+4P3/2 collisions for populating 5P, while the opposite is true for populating 6S. Since fluorescence from 4D was not seen, we can only report an upper limit for that rate coefficient.},

abstract = {In this reference we present many of the physical and optical properties of 85Rb that are relevant to various quantum optics experiments. In particular, we give parameters that are useful in treating the mechanical effects of light on 85Rb atoms. The measured numbers are given with their original references, and the calculated numbers are presented with an overview of their calculation along with references to more comprehensive discussions of their underlying theory. At present, this document is not a critical review of experimental data, nor is it even guaranteed to be correct; for any numbers critical to your research, you should consult the original references. We also present a detailed discussion of the calculation of fluorescence scattering rates, because this topic is often not treated clearly in the literature. More},

The proposed technique is$\backslash$nbased on the existence of two degenerate dark states (i.e. states$\backslash$nhaving no component of the excited state) and their interaction.$\backslash$nThe mixing of the dark states can be controlled by changing the relative$\backslash$ndelay of the pulses, and thus an arbitrary superposition state can$\backslash$nbe generated. It is shown that the method is robust against small$\backslash$nvariations of parameters (e.g. the area of the pulses) and is insensitive$\backslash$nto radiative decay from the intermediate excited state. A time reversed$\backslash$nversion of the technique makes possible the determination of phase$\backslash$noccurring in a superposition of two atomic states.},

abstract = {We present an experimental study of energy transfer in a thermal vapor of atomic rubidium. We measure the fluorescence spectrum in the visible and near infra-red as a function of atomic density using confocal microscopy. At low density we observe energy transfer consistent with the well-known energy pooling process. In contrast, above a critical density we observe a dramatic enhancement of the fluorescence from high-lying states that is not to be expected from kinetic theory. We show that the density threshold for excitation on the D1 and D2 resonance line corresponds to the value at which the dipole-dipole interactions begins to dominate, thereby indicate the key role of these interactions in the enhanced emission.},

@article{Zentile2015,
abstract = {Abstract We present a computer program and underlying model to calculate the electric susceptibility of a gas, which is essential to predict its absorptive and dispersive properties. Our program focuses on alkali-metal vapours where we use a matrix representation of the atomic Hamiltonian in the completely uncoupled basis in order to calculate transition frequencies and strengths. The program calculates various spectra for a weak-probe laser beam in an atomic medium with an applied axial magnetic field. This allows many optical devices to be designed, such as Faraday rotators/filters, optical isolators and circular polarisation filters. Fitting routines are also provided with the program which allows the user to perform optical metrology by fitting to experimental data. Program summary Program title: ElecSus Catalogue identifier: AEVD{\_}v1{\_}0 Program summary URL:http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/AEVD{\_}v1{\_}0.html Program obtainable from: {\{}CPC{\}} Program Library, Queen?s University, Belfast, N. Ireland Licensing provisions: Apache License, version 2 No. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc.: No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.: Distribution format: tar.gz Programming language: Python. Computer: Any single computer running Python 2. Operating system: Linux, Mac OSX, Windows. RAM: Depends on the precision required and size of the data set, but typically not larger than 50 MiB. Classification: 2.2, 2.3. External routines: SciPy library [1] 0.12.0 or later, NumPy [1], matplotlib [2] Nature of problem: Calculating the weak-probe electric susceptibility of an alkali-metal vapour. The electric susceptibility can be used to calculate spectra such as transmission and Stokes parameters. Measurements of experimental parameters can be made by fitting the theory to data. Solution method: The transition frequencies and wavelengths are calculated using a matrix representation of the Hamiltonian in the completely uncoupled basis. A suite of fitting methods are provided in order to allow user supplied experimental data to be fit to the theory, thereby allowing experimental parameters to be extracted. Restrictions: Only describes a magnetic field parallel to the laser beam propagation direction. Results are only valid in the weak-probe regime. Running time: At standard precision less than a second for a theory curve, fitting will take 10 s to 20 min depending on the method used, the number of parameters to fit and the number of data points.
