  \label{chp:conclusions}

  We began this thesis by describing in chapter \ref{chp:propagation} a model
  for the propagation of pulses in dense thermal atomic vapours, based on the
  Maxwell Bloch equations. We introduced the regimes of linear and nonlinear
  optics, and using the propagation model presented the concepts and simulated
  examples of two important nonlinear techniques: \textsc{sit} and the
  propagation of optical solitons and simultons in chapter \ref{chp:nonlinear},
  and three-level \textsc{eit} and the propagation, storage and retrieval of
  dark-state polaritons in chapter \ref{chp:polaritons}.

  In chapter \ref{chp:twophoton} we investigated the properties of two-photon
  excitation of a rubidium vapour with high-intensity beam, which required
  consideration of hyperfine pumping and thus the degenerate hyperfine structure
  of the coupled atomic states. We were able to rule out such two-photon
  excitation as a cause, and even as a significant contribution, of the dramatic
  increase in fluorescence observed in experimental data taken when scanning
  over resonance with the \textsc{d2} lines.

  Finally, in chapter \ref{chp:simultons}, we constructed a model to explain an
  interesting observed nonlinear effect, making use of the effects of
  \textsc{sit} and \textsc{eit} previously introduced, indicating that this is,
  to our knowledge, a first observation of simulton propagation in an atomic
  vapour. Moreover, by considering the behaviour of the system over longer
  propagation distances, we described an approach for facilitating propagation
  of weak pulses through dense atomic vapours.

  The \textit{OpticalBloch} software package developed for solving the Maxwell
  Bloch equations is presented in appendix \ref{apx:mb_eqns} and was used for
  producing the numerical results throughout this thesis. It has been designed
  to be easily extensible to other systems, including those with many atomic
  levels and with multiple co-propagating fields.

  In discussing the model of simulton propagation in chapter
  \ref{chp:simultons}, we justified averaging over the hyperfine sublevels in
  excited states, however an obvious and useful extension to the model will be
  to include the angular momentum structure developed in chapter
  \ref{chp:twophoton} to account for any effects due to degeneracy and optical
  pumping.

  Experimental work has begun to investigate propagation of simultons over
  longer distances in micron-scale Caesium vapour cells, which will enable us to
  test the feasibility of weak propagation using the simulton scheme. 

  An exciting extension of the scheme would be in the possibility of coupling
  using Rydberg states in order to introduce strong dipole-dipole interactions
  between atoms to mediate interactions between solitons, with applications for
  photonic quantum information
  processing.\cite{Maxwell2013,Maghrebi2015,Peyronel2012}
