  {Conclusions}
  \label{chp:conclusions}

  - Revise what we covered

  - SIT chapter conclusions

  - Two-photon chapter conclusions

  - The code and how generic it is

  - Extension to degenerate systems (combining those two results chapters)

  - Future: experiments in Cs cell, longer, to confirm soliton propagation and look
  for conclusive experimental evidence of simultons.

  - Future: Simultons coupling to Rydberg states to introduce dipole-dipole interactions.
