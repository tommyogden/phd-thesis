\section{Introduction}
  \label{sec:nonlinear_intro}

  In chapter \ref{chp:propagation} we introduced a model for the propagation of
  light through a thermal atomic vapour, based on the Maxwell-Bloch equations.
  We presented analytic solutions of those equations in the linear regime of a
  weak applied field, and introduced computational methods (described in
  appendix \ref{apx:mb_eqns}) to solve the equations beyond the weak field
  approximations.

  In this chapter, we will take the model beyond the weak probe and into the
  nonlinear regime, demonstrating some of the effects that emerge from the
  interaction of thermal atomic vapours with strong applied fields: notably
  \textit{self-induced transparency}. We will also introduce light propagation
  in three-level atoms, which has been found to result in a variety of
  interesting phenomena due to the existence of \textit{dark} superposition
  states. 

  Putting these together in the final section, we will look at strong applied
  fields in three-level atoms leading to propagation of \textit{matched pulses}
  and \textit{simultons}.
