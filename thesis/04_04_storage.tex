\section{Storage \& Retreival of Dark-State Polaritons}
  \label{sec:polaritons_storage}

    We can look at the propagation of the probe pulse through the \textsc{eit}
    medium from the perspective of the atoms. Before the pulse arrives at an
    atom at a position $z$ in the medium, the atom has been optically pumped
    into the ground state $\Ket{0}$ by the coupling field. At this point the
    state is equivalent to the dark state described in equation
    \ref{eqn:lambda_eigvects}. As the leading edge of the pulse hits the atom,
    it remains in the dark state but transfers a component of its wavevector
    into a superposition between states $\Ket{0}$ and $\Ket{2}$. In this way
    energy is transferred from the probe into the medium. As the pulse reaches
    its peak and the trailing edge leaves the atom, that energy is returned to
    the pulse.

    Fleischhauer and Lukin introduced a useful formalism for describing
    \textsc{eit} medium with a quasiparticle known as the \textit{dark state
    polariton}. We define a collective mixing angle $\vartheta$ via
    \begin{equation}
      \tan{\vartheta}(z, \tau) = \frac{\sqrt{Ng}}{\Omega_D(z, \tau)}
    \end{equation}
    and then the dark polariton field envelope $\Omega_D$ is given by
    \begin{equation}
      \Omega_D(z,\tau) = \cos{\vartheta}(z, \tau)~\Omega_p(z, \tau) - 
        \sin{\vartheta}(z, \tau) ~ \sqrt{Ng} \rho_{20}(z, \tau).
    \end{equation}
    The dark state polariton quasiparticle thus describes the propagation in
    terms of a coherent mixture of the electromagnetic field with atomic spin
    wave excitation.
    
    In the linear regime and on resonance it can be shown[ref FQOQI] that
    $\Omega_D$ obeys 
    \begin{equation}
      \left[ \frac{\partial}{\partial t} + c \cos^2 \vartheta 
      \frac{\partial}{\partial z} \right] \Omega_D = 0,
    \end{equation}
    a wave equation describing a shape-preserving propagation with group
    velocity $v_g = c \cos^2 \vartheta$.

    % \begin{subequations}
    % \begin{align}
    %   \Omega_p &= \cos{\vartheta} \Omega_D \\
    %   \sqrt{Ng} \rho_{20} &= -\sin{\vartheta} \Omega_D
    % \end{align}
    % \end{subequations}

  \subsection{Storage \& Retrieval}

    \begin{figure}[]
      \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]

      \caption{
        Simulated absolute value of $\Omega_p(z, \tau)$ for the propagation of a
        Gaussian pulse with area $\theta_p = $ \unit[0.2]{$\pi$} and
        \textsc{fwhm} $\tau_w = $ \unit[1]{$\tau_\Gamma$} through the same
        $\Lambda$-type medium as in figure \ref{fig:pulse_compression}.
        In this simulation the \textsc{cw} coupling field with $\Omega_c = $
        \unit[$2\pi~10$]{$\Gamma$} is ramped down at  \unit[4]{$\tau_\Gamma$}
        and ramped up again at \unit[8]{$\tau_\Gamma$}.
      }
      \label{fig:eit_storage}
    \end{figure}

    In figure \ref{fig:eit_storage} we show the results of the simulated
    propagation of the same probe pulse as we considered in figure
    \ref{fig:pulse_compression}, a Gaussian with area $\theta_p = $
    \unit[0.2]{$\pi$} and \textsc{fwhm} $\tau_w = $ \unit[1]{$\tau_\Gamma$}. The
    $\Lambda$-type medium also has the same non-uniform density, having a
    Gaussian profile of \textsc{fwhm} \unit[0.5]{L} and a peak density such that
    $N_{\mathrm{max}} g = \unit[2\pi~500]{\Gamma/L}$.

    The difference in this case is that the coupling field is time dependent,
    being ramped down (see equation [REf]) over a period of
    \unit[0.5]{$\tau_\Gamma$} at $t' = $\unit[4]{$\tau_\Gamma$} and ramped up
    again at $t' = $\unit[8]{$\tau_\Gamma$}.

    We see that the effect is that the pulse envelope vanishes as the coupling
    field is ramped down, but returns dramatically, with the same profile, as
    the coupling field is ramped back up. It appears as though the light has
    been `stopped' by the medium before being allowed to continue on its way. We
    can understand this behaviour by considering the propagation of the dark
    state polariton in this system.
